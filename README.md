# Web-Design
Here is a web design of a student survey form. The video shows some features of implementing one Servlet that acts as a front controller, receives all client requests and saves the form data to a database table using the GMU Oracle database.

These files are the major functional resources of this maven project. In the StudentDAO.java file, you need to fill in your database URL, your username, and your password.
